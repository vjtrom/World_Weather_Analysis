Overview of the World Weather Analysis:

This week, students were introduced to using APIs and Python. APIs are a powerful way to integrate web host data into your analysis. This might inlcude new articles, government data, google maps data, and other sources. API data can be free or paid. In addition to gaining a familiarity with these tools, students were given a real-world simulation to see how APIs can be integrated into an analysis. Lessons learned include:

- Using new Python libraries and modules.
- Using APIs to retreive data
- Understanding JSON formatting
- Storing values from a JSON array
- Using try and except blocks
- Using Weather and Google Maps API
- How to use API keys
- Performing linear regressions using Matplotlib
- Creating heat maps using Google maps

Using Python, APIs, Pandas, Numpy and other libraries, this week's challenge introduces the students to new concepts and helps continue building foundations in data analysis and visualization.
